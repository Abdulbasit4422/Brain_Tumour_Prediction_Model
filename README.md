# Brain Tumor Prediction Model

<br><br>


## 📌 Problem Statement
Brain tumors are a critical health concern, requiring early and accurate detection for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods like MRI scans rely heavily on radiologists' expertise, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Automated brain tumor detection using deep learning can assist medical professionals by providing faster and more consistent predictions.
 <br><br><br>

## 🎯 Objective 
This project aims to:

✔ Classify brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor) from MRI scans using deep learning.<br>
✔ Improve diagnostic efficiency by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).<br>
✔ Provide a user-friendly and scalable model for medical applications.<br>
<br><br><br>

## 📂 Dataset
 The model is trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, which contains:
 - 4 Classes: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor
 - Image Format: MRI scans in .jpg or .png
 - Source: ([https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)).
<br><br><br>


## 🛠 Skills & Technologies Used

 * Programming and Framework
 * Python (Primary language)
 * Data wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
 * Data Analysis and Visualization. (Numpy, Stat, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
 * Pytorch (Deep Learning)
 * OpenCV (Image Preprocessing)
   
###  Machine Learning Techniques
✔ CNN Architecture (ResNet50, EfficientNet, or Custom CNN) <br>
✔ Data Augmentation (Rotation, Zoom, Flip) <br>
✔ Transfer Learning (Fine-tuning pre-trained models) <br>
✔ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) <br>


## 📍 Notebook
 #### This Jupyter notebook containing some exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Abdulbasit4422/Brain_Tumour_Prediction_Model/blob/main/brain-tumour-prediction-model%20(1).ipynb) <br><br><br>

## ⚠ Limitations & Challenges
1. Data Imbalance: Some tumor classes may have fewer samples, affecting model bias.<br>
2. Computational Cost: Training deep learning models requires GPU acceleration for efficiency.<br>
3. Generalization: The model may struggle with low-quality or noisy MRI scans.<br>
4. Ethical Considerations: AI should assist, not replace, medical professionals. <br>
<br><br><br>
 


## 🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Deploy as a Web App (Flask/Django + TensorFlow.js) <br>
✅ Improve Model Explainability (Grad-CAM, SHAP) <br>
✅ Expand Dataset (More diverse MRI scans) <br>
✅ Optimize for Mobile (TensorFlow Lite for edge devices) <br>
